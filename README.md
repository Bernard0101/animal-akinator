This is a simple yet creative project I thought of, it basicaly is a animal guesser. 
It works following this principle the main structure is the tree algorithm, it is created with multiple nested dicts, the program begins with a set of Q&A's that ask the user if the animal
thought of fits the given question, if yes the user may proceed deeper into the tree, until it arrives at the desired animal, and finaly the computer may get it right or wrong. 
If the computer did not get it right the user is prompted with a series of questions about his thought animal to increase the computer capability, so that nextime he may get it right
